Database Optimization:
Assume you have an existing PostgreSQL database with a table named "orders" that 
has the following columns: 
• id (integer), 
• customer_id (integer), 
• order_date (date), 
• total_amount (decimal).
Optimize the following SQL query to improve its performance:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123 ORDER BY order_date DESC;


ANSWER:
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id_order_date ON orders (customer_id, order_date);

SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 123
ORDER BY order_date DESC;

The INDEX keyword creates an index on the customer_id and order_date columns. The index will be used by the database to quickly find the rows that match the WHERE clause. This will improve the performance of the query.
